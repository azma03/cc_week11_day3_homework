Answer the following questions:

1) What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
It will pause the application at that point and helps to debug any errors in the code.

2) Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
The application will pause before running the line the code on which the breakpoint is added.

3) How do we debug the next line of code?
We can use the step over option from the debugger console.

4) What does the step into command do?
Step into command will run the current highlighted line of code and takes us into the definition of the function if there is any.
It will go to the first line of code in that method definition and pause there.

5) What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluate expression runs single line of code on the variables at that stage point in debugging.
Whereas Evaluate code fragment mode allows us to write and run multiple lines of code and methods at that point in debugging.
